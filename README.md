Keymini is a minimalist keyboard in a lot of way:
* Only a keyboard, no LED, no rotary encoder, no screen, no multiple
  parts… Just USB-C connector and keys.
* Minimal size, entering in a C5/6 envelope (3 fold A4) or a Nintendo
  Switch Lite case.
* Minimal number of keys, at 36, as popularized by
  [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku).
* Minimal keyspacing, following the classical "choc spacing."
* Minimal height, with the switch plate at 5.8 mm from the desk.
* Minimal number of component, with only 2 extended parts for PCB
  assembly by JLCPCB.
* Minimalistic style, with no decoration, simple hull countour.
* Minimalist license (MIT) for an opensource keyboard.
